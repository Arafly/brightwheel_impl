## IAM RBAC Implementation

This is a high-level overview of how to implement a role-based access control (RBAC) system for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) that supports multiple development teams with specific areas of product focus. The following steps can be taken. Paying attention to the engineering teams to ensure the prevention of privilege escalation attacks, at the same time considering things like: cost analysis, security, automation, monitoring, and logging. 

Firstly with the identification of the specific AWS tools and technology that each development team requires access to - CloudFront, EKS and Redshift for the Frontend, Backend and Data Engineering Team respectively, we're in the right direction to follow these steps:

The RBAC implementation can be achieved in AWS using the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service. IAM enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. To implement RBAC in this scenario, we will create IAM roles with appropriate permissions and assign those roles to IAM users or groups.

We will create four IAM groups, one for each engineering team (Frontend, Backend, Data and SRE), and assign IAM roles with appropriate permissions to these groups. Each team will have access only to the AWS services they require for their respective areas of focus. 

> The Site Reliability Engineering team will have administrator access and will be responsible for managing the IAM roles and permissions.

We will use Terraform to automate the creation of IAM groups, roles, and policies (any IaC tool should do the job). Terraform provides a way to manage infrastructure as code and ensures consistency across different environments. 

The following steps can be taken to implement RBAC in AWS using IAM are highlighted below:

1. AWS Organizations is utilized to create a hard isolation between production environment and non-production environments by creating them as separate accounts for each environment (i.e Dev, QA, and Production). This provides adequate workloads isolation or even for applications that have specific security requirements, or the need to meet strict guidelines for compliance such as HIPAA, PCI and also limit the impact of potential security breaches by lowering the risk of exposing production data in non-production environments.

2. An IAM group is created for each engineering team (Frontend Engineering, Backend Engineering, and Data Engineering), and assign the appropriate AWS IAM roles that grants only the necessary permissions to their respective tools and technology. For example, the Data Team focused on data would need access to Amazon Redshift, while the Backend team focused on web development might need access to Amazon EC2, S3 and EKS.

3. Individual users should be assignedto the appropriate IAM groups based on their team membership, this should be done with an automation tool (Terraform is being used in this implementation).

> Implement the principle of least privilege by granting only the minimum required permissions for each IAM role. This ensures that a compromised account cannot escalate privileges and access unauthorized resources.

4. Implement AWS CloudTrail to monitor and log all API calls made to AWS resources. This can help identify any suspicious or unauthorized activity, and also provide a record of all changes made to AWS resources. This can be used to detect and prevent privilege escalation attacks (ensure more robustness by pairing with IAM Access Analyzer to continuously monitor and analyze policies applied to your AWS resources).

5. Regularly review and update IAM policies and group assignments to ensure that they align with the changing needs of each development team and the overall AWS ecosystem. Also utilize tools like AWS Config or Open Policy Agent (OPA) to monitor compliance with the defined IAM roles and policies. Alerts should also be set up to notify administrators if there are any non-compliant resources.

6. We can make use of a number of AWS Tool offering to analye and optimize cost, tools such as AWS Budgets, Cost Explorer, and Trusted Advisor. Also, Tagging resources with cost allocation tags can help you track and analyze cost and usage data for Brightwheel's AWS resources. For example, you can use tags to identify resources that are used for development, testing, or production purposes. You can also use tags to identify resources that are used by a specific team or department.


#### How users of the system are managed:

IAM users will be created for each member of the engineering teams and added to the appropriate IAM groups.
Users will be managed through the AWS Management Console or programmatically using the AWS CLI or SDKs.

#### Any additional assumptions that were made:

1. It is assumed that the engineering teams do not require access to any additional AWS services beyond CloudFront, EKS, and Redshift.

2. It is assumed that there are no other users or groups in the AWS account that require access to these AWS services.

3. It is assumed that the Site Reliability Engineering team has sufficient expertise to manage the IAM roles and permissions.

4. Individual users don't interact with resources outside of their assigned group. For example, if a member of the data team needs to doesn't need access to an Amazon CloudFront.

5. It is assumed that the engineering teams do not require access to any additional AWS services beyond CloudFront, EKS, and Redshift.


**If given more time I would:**

1. I would implement a more robust solution to the problem, such as using AWS SSO (Single Sign-On) to provide a central point of access for all AWS resources. This simplifies access management and improves automation.


2. Use AWS Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security to Brightwheel's AWS account. This ensures that only authorized users can access the AWS account, and also prevents unauthorized access to the company's AWS resources in the event that a user's credentials are compromised.

3. Use AWS Secrets Manager or Hashicorp Vault to securely store and manage credentials and secrets for access to AWS services.
